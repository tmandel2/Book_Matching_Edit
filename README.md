### User Stories

The user lands on a login/registration page. After entering the app, they have a home page that displays their favorite books. If they do not currently have a book that they would like on their favorites, they can search for books, which uses Google's book API. When adding a book from the search page, the book is also added to the database for other users to add to their favorites.

Deleting a book from a favorites page doesn't not delete from the database.
Deleting from the database deletes from everyone's favorites pages.
